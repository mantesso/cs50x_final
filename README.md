# Image dithering algorithms app
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/AoYENxlY63k
#### Description:
This application is a web-based tool designed for applying dithering effects to images. Dithering is a digital image processing technique used to create the illusion of color depth in images with a limited color palette. This application allows users to upload images and apply various dithering effects in real-time.
#####Features

    Image Upload: Users can upload images, which are then rendered onto an HTML canvas for processing.
    Dithering Effects: Multiple dithering algorithms are available, each defined by unique kernels like Floyd-Steinberg, Stucki, and Burkes.
    Grayscale Conversion: An optional feature to convert images to grayscale before applying dithering effects.
    Real-Time Processing: Instant visual feedback is provided on the canvas as different dithering effects are applied.

#####How It Works

    Canvas API: The application uses the HTML5 Canvas API for manipulating image data at the pixel level.
    ImageData Objects: Manipulation of images is achieved through ImageData objects, which represent the pixel data of the canvas.
    JavaScript Interactivity: The application is built with JavaScript, ensuring dynamic interaction and immediate response to user inputs.

#####Installation and Setup

No installation is required. Access the application through a web browser. Ensure JavaScript is enabled for full functionality.
